#  Vokabel Meister

During my German learning journey, I encountered many paid and ad-filled apps.  
Instead of relying on them, I decided to **build my own tool**, both to save money and to practice my coding skills.  

Currently, the project is a web application, but a **mobile app (React Native)** version is also planned.
